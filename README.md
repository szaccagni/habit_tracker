# 2022 Personal Habit Tracker
#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qto465XLN2E
#### Description:
  This project is built using the Flask web framework and was built as my final project for Harvard's cs50. I look forward to refining this concept and building out the app further. 
  
  This web application allows you to track habits on daily basis.
You can track as many habits as you like as well as add and remove them as time goes on and your needs change.
Don't worry though! If you remove a habit, you can still look back on your tracked history of that habit.
I have preloaded all dates for the 2022 calendar year for this web application.
